## Paper
Draft coming soon

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has conventionally adopted a perspective of racial color-blindness (i.e., difference unaware treatment). We contend that in a range of important settings, group *difference awareness* matters. For example, in the legal system it can be permissible to discriminate (e.g., Native Americans have privileged legal status in certain situations, men enter the compulsory draft in America while women do not). In our work we first make an important distinction between descriptive (fact-based), normative (value-based), and indicator (correlation-based) benchmarks. Then, we present a benchmark suite that spans these two categories as well as eight different contexts for a total of 16k questions that enables us to assess for difference awareness. Finally, we show results across ten models that show difference awareness is a distinct dimension of fairness where existing bias mitigation strategies may backfire.

## Code
- All eight benchmarks are in the folder `./benchmark_suite/`
- Code to generate each of the eight benchmarks are in `./benchmark_suite/generate_datasets/*/organize_data.py`
- run_benchmark.py will run a model against the specified benchmarks.
    - `python3 run_benchmark.py --input_prompts 1000 1001 --model llama-3.1-7b` will run Llama-3.1 7b using HuggingFace on the D1 benchmark
- Analysis code: coming soon
